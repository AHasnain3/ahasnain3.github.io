## Research

**JetAuto Autonomous Navigation:**

As a Visiting Researcher at Clarkson University, I lead a project team of undergraduate and masterâ€™s students developing methods for autonomous navigation on the JetAuto robot.

Using **neural networks, ROS, and OpenCV**, we have built perception, control, and vision pipelines that enable the robot to navigate real-world environments autonomously.  

I report directly to [**Chuck Thorpe**](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/chuck-thorpe), a pioneer in robotics, who serves as my mentor on this research.
