## Research

**JetAuto Autonomous Navigation (with Chuck Thorpe)**  
Using **neural networks, ROS, and OpenCV**, we developed methods to enable a JetAuto robot to navigate autonomously.  
This research was conducted under the supervision of [**Chuck Thorpe**](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/chuck-thorpe), a pioneer in robotics.  
Our work focused on perception, control, and vision pipelines for robust real-world navigation.
