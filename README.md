## Research

**JetAuto Autonomous Navigation**  
As a Visiting Researcher at Clarkson University, I lead a project team of undergraduate and master‚Äôs students developing methods for autonomous navigation on the JetAuto robot.  
Using **neural networks, ROS, and OpenCV**, we have built perception, control, and vision pipelines that enable the robot to navigate real-world environments autonomously.  
I report directly to [**Chuck Thorpe**](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/chuck-thorpe), a pioneer in robotics, who serves as my mentor on this research.
