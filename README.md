## Research

**JetAuto Autonomous Navigation:**

As a Visiting Researcher at Clarkson University, I lead a project team of undergraduate and master‚Äôs students developing methods for autonomous navigation on a Jetson Nano robot.

Using **neural networks, ROS, and OpenCV**, we are building perception, control, and vision pipelines that enable the robot to navigate environments autonomously.  

I report directly to [**Chuck Thorpe**](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/chuck-thorpe), a pioneer in robotics, who serves as my mentor on this research.
