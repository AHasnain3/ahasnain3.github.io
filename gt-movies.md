## Project Description
**GT Movies Store** is a Django 5 web app built for CS 2340 at Georgia Tech. It lets people browse a movie catalog, search by title, view details and reviews, sign up/log in, add reviews, and manage purchases with a cart and orders. The goal was to turn a clear set of user stories into a working, easy-to-use site.

**How the user stories were satisfied:**
- **Discovery:** Home/About pages orient users; **Movies** index lists all titles with a **search** bar.
- **Accounts:** **Sign Up / Login / Logout** flows; actions like writing reviews or ordering require being signed in.
- **Details & Reviews:** Movie pages show full info; users can **create, edit, and delete** their own reviews and read others.
- **Cart & Orders:** Add/remove items, adjust quantities, and **checkout** to create an **order** with date/total and a viewable history.
- **Usability:** Responsive templates keep pages clean on different screen sizes; an **admin** area manages movies, reviews, users, and orders.

## Process Description
I followed *Django 5 for the Impatient* and Django‚Äôs **Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìTemplate (MVT)** structure:

- Defined models for **Movie**, **Review**, **Cart**, **Order**, etc.
- Built views/URLs and templates for pages.
- Implemented forms for creating/editing records; gated actions with user signup/login/logout.
- Used **Django Admin** to manage data while testing.
- Kept the UI simple and responsive with Bootstrap.

### Challenges & Notes
- **What was tricky:** There were many moments where my site looked drastically different from the book's example. This was often due to broken HTML lines in the code, etc.
- **How I solved it:** Reviewing the code carefully before deploying, and making use of Git Version Control.
- **If I had more time:** I would love to expand on the site by integrating data from the IMDb API.
