## Project Description
GT Movies Store is a web application built with **Django 5** (based on *Django for the Impatient*).  
It enables users to browse, search, and manage movies, addressing user stories like:

- Viewing a list of all movies  
- Searching movies by title  
- Adding and editing entries  
- Managing user authentication (sign up/login)  

---

## Process Description
I followed Django’s **Model–Template–View (MTV)** approach:  
- Defined models for `Movie` (title, genre, year).  
- Built views and templates for browsing and managing movies.  
- Implemented forms for creating/editing records.  
- Debugged and tested each step iteratively, using both the Django shell and in-browser checks.
